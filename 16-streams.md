# Streams

### Streams
General description
- Allows data syndication for other systems.
- Acts like a global log.
- We can configure a consumer thats receives a copy of the data in the feed.
- All stream commands are prefixed with an X.
- In theory, Streams are logically infinite, but Redis servers don’t have infinite memory, we need to control the length of a stream
- Node redis returns stream entries as nested array so it needs to be parsed if we want an Object structure-

Is a data Structure that models an append-only log. Every Stream has a set of key:value pairs. For the Redisolar system, we have this field-value pairs:

```
- entry:
    - ID: `123456789-0`
    - Fields:
        - `siteId:2`
        - `wHg:0.25`
        - `wHu:0.17`
        - `tempC:18.0`
```

### Streams Commands
- **XADD**: `XADD [streamname] [MAXLEN] [ID] [field-value pairs]` the stream name is a key, the ID could be autogenerated by Redis, using `*` character.
    - Ex: `XADD test:stream * siteId 1 tempC 18.0` The command returns the generated ID.
    - **MAXLEN** will keep the stream from growing beyond a specified number of messages. So Approximate length trimming gives a slight performance advantage when trimming the stream’s length.
- **XRANGE**: `XRANGE` reads entries from oldest to newest.
- **XREVRANGE**: `XREVRANGE` reads from entries newest to oldest.
    - EX: `XREVRANGE test:stream + - COUNT 1` We can use the special characters `+` or `-` to automatically retrieve the highest and the lowest possibly ID respectly.
    - Returns an array whose first element is the IDand the second are the stored FEED.
