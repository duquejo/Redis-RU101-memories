# Sets

Unordered collections list of strings that contains no duplicates: {3,1,5}. Is not guaranteed an specific items order. If you need any order, use **SORTED SETS data structure.**

**Works only with the STRING datatype, nested LIST, SET, SORTED SET or HASH are not allowed, and only works with flat strings.**

SETS works too with **EXPIRE, so you can configure a TTL for a specific number of seconds. ALL ELEMENTS are deleted when EXPIRE is setted.**

**Time-scoped key expiration strategy definition:**
